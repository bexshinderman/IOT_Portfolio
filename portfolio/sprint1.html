            Sprint One 27th Feb - 5th of March.

            Coming into Project I had originally wanted to focus primarily on on my sysadmin skills but I also wanted to work om my web & database skills. As such, it was reccommemded to me by the Project Coordinator that the Internet Of Things team would likely be a good fit. After our very first session I could see that there was a lot to do and a lot to learn. Untill this semester, the IOT was just something I had only written an essay about in 2015 and seen as a buzz word in varying tech blogs. 
            
            The first technical challenge that was impossible to ignore was the lack of access to our files and documentation. During the semesters before hand the IOT group had been hosting their files on the gitlab server run by the DevOps project team, bit-ip.gitlab.com After one week passed without any access to files or documentation I suggested to my project supervisor that perhaps we migrate elsewhere so we could begin developing. Not only was it a bother to have our project hosted there, we also couldn't find a good reason to stay there. By maintaing our own project on gitlab we would have more controll & less downtime. After doing some Googling I used gitlab's import/export feature to migrate us from https://gitlab.op-bit.nz/BIT/Project/Internet-Of-Things to gitlab.com/iotop. This meant requesting temporary maintainer access from the DevOps so I could export our repositories. Suprisingly it took a good 3 hours to export and import the reposotories.My biggest considerations when completing this project was loss of data, maintaining permissions and ensuring as little down time as possible. To ensure these considerations were satisfied I first did a back up both locally and on a personal harddrive of each of my teams repositories. I also made sure to communicate closely with the DevOps team through Microsoft Teams so they were able to revoke my maintainer access by the end of the business day. Luckily, Gitlab's import/export feature made mainting permissions over repositories easy, private repositories remained private when uploaded. I discovered that I had accidently added a protected tag to a repository that was supposed to be public - but this was ammended within a few hours of my team mate messaging me on Teams. I decided to give myself, my supervisor and our other sysadmin Maintainer access over the Project so there wouldn't be any future hassles with access.
